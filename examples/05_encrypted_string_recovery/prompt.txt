# Exercise 05: Recover Encrypted/Obfuscated Strings (Static)
Category: B. Strings, Dataflow-ish Heuristics, and Configuration Recovery

## Binary
input.i64

## Binary Requirements
- Binary with encrypted/obfuscated strings:
  - XOR-encoded strings (single-byte or rolling key)
  - RC4-encrypted string table
  - Base64 + XOR combinations
  - Stack-constructed strings (char-by-char)
- Decryptor functions with identifiable patterns:
  - Tight loops with XOR/ADD operations
  - S-box table references (RC4)
  - Unusual entropy in referenced data sections
- At least 20-30 obfuscated strings

## Task
1. Identify candidate decryptor functions by patterns:
   - Tight loops with XOR/ADD/SUB operations
   - RC4-ish table initialization and usage
   - High-entropy data references

2. Automate extraction:
   - Pattern-match and decode (for simple XOR)
   - Or emulate enough of the decryptor
   - Recover plaintext strings
   - Create new string literals in IDA
   - Add xrefs from usage sites to recovered strings

## Expected Output
- List of recovered strings with:
  - Original encrypted blob EA
  - Decryptor function EA
  - Decryption method identified
  - Plaintext result
- IDA database updated with string definitions

## Expected Class of Solution
- Heuristic-based decryptor identification
- Multiple decryption strategy support (XOR, RC4, custom)
- Either:
  - Pattern matching + static decode, OR
  - Lightweight emulation (Unicorn or similar)
- Proper IDA string/xref creation via APIs

## Evaluation Criteria
- Decryptor function detection accuracy
- String recovery completeness
- Handling of multiple encryption schemes
- IDA integration quality (strings visible in UI)
