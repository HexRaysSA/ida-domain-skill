# Exercise 18: Binary-to-SARIF (or Similar) Audit Export
Category: E. Patch Planning & Analysis Workflow Automation

## Binary
input.i64

## Binary Requirements
- Binary with various security-relevant patterns:
  - Dangerous API usage (strcpy, sprintf, gets, etc.)
  - Hardcoded secrets (keys, passwords, tokens)
  - High-entropy regions (potential crypto keys, packed data)
  - Anti-debug checks
  - Self-modifying code indicators
  - Insecure random number generation
- Mix of severity levels:
  - Critical: hardcoded keys, command injection
  - High: buffer overflow potential
  - Medium: anti-analysis techniques
  - Low: deprecated API usage

## Task
Write a script that exports security findings into a standard format (SARIF or similar JSON):

1. Detect and categorize:
   - Dangerous APIs used (location + context)
   - Hardcoded keys/secrets (high-entropy strings, known patterns)
   - Suspicious entropy regions
   - Anti-debug checks (IsDebuggerPresent, timing checks, etc.)
   - Self-modifying code indicators
   - Insecure patterns (weak crypto, predictable random)

2. For each finding, include:
   - Precise EA
   - Category and severity
   - Instruction range / code snippet
   - Context (function, callsite)
   - Remediation suggestion (where applicable)

3. Export in structured format:
   - SARIF (preferred, for tool integration)
   - Or well-structured JSON

## Expected Output
- SARIF/JSON report with all findings
- Findings grouped by category and severity
- Each finding with precise location and context
- Summary statistics

## Expected Class of Solution
- API usage scanning with context
- Entropy analysis for secrets detection
- Pattern matching for known bad patterns
- Anti-debug API and technique detection
- SARIF schema compliance (or documented JSON schema)

## Evaluation Criteria
- Detection coverage
- False positive rate
- Output format correctness
- Integration-readiness (can other tools consume it?)
