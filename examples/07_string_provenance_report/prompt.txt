# Exercise 07: Build a String Provenance Report
Category: B. Strings, Dataflow-ish Heuristics, and Configuration Recovery

## Binary
input.i64

## Binary Requirements
- Binary with diverse "interesting" strings:
  - URLs and IP addresses
  - File paths (Windows/Unix)
  - Registry keys
  - Command-line patterns
  - API endpoint paths
  - Crypto-related strings (key names, algorithms)
- Clear functional separation:
  - Network communication code
  - Persistence mechanisms
  - Anti-debug/anti-VM checks
  - Configuration handling
- ~50+ interesting strings across different features

## Task
For every interesting string (matched by regex: URL, IP, path, registry, etc.):
1. Find all xrefs to the string
2. Trace up the caller chain (configurable depth)
3. Compute the set of functions that produce or consume it
4. Group strings by "feature" category:
   - Network (URLs, IPs, ports)
   - Persistence (registry, startup paths)
   - Anti-debug (debug API strings)
   - File operations (paths, extensions)
   - Crypto (algorithm names, key IDs)

## Expected Output
Report grouped by feature:
- Feature name
- Strings in this category
- For each string:
  - String value
  - String EA
  - Direct references (function + call site)
  - Call chain(s) to reach it

## Expected Class of Solution
- Regex-based string classification
- Xref enumeration and caller chain traversal
- Configurable depth limit for chain analysis
- Feature categorization logic
- Structured output (JSON/Markdown)

## Evaluation Criteria
- String pattern matching coverage
- Correct xref and caller chain computation
- Meaningful feature groupings
- Report clarity and usefulness
