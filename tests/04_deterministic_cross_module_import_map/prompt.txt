# Exercise 04: Cross-Module Import Usage Map
Category: A. Triage & Global Mapping

## Binary
input.i64

## Binary Requirements
- Dynamically linked binary with diverse imports:
  - Standard library (libc, kernel32, etc.)
  - Crypto libraries (OpenSSL, CryptoAPI)
  - Network APIs (socket, WinHTTP, etc.)
  - File I/O functions
- Should include some dynamic import resolution:
  - GetProcAddress / dlsym patterns
  - LoadLibrary / dlopen usage
- ~100+ import references across the binary

## Task
Enumerate imports and build a per-import usage map:
- Which functions call which imports
- Call frequency per import
- Call site addresses

Bonus: Detect dynamically resolved imports (GetProcAddress patterns) and include them as "pseudo-imports"

## Expected Output
- Import usage map (JSON or structured report):
  - import_name -> [{caller_func, call_site, count}]
- Per-function import profile
- Bonus: pseudo-import discoveries with resolution patterns

## Expected Class of Solution
- Complete import enumeration via IDA APIs
- Xref traversal from import entries
- For bonus: pattern matching on GetProcAddress/dlsym:
  - Track string argument to resolve function name
  - Handle both immediate strings and string references
  - Map resolved address usage

## Evaluation Criteria
- Complete coverage of static imports
- Accurate call site mapping
- Bonus: quality of dynamic import detection
- Output format usefulness for further analysis
