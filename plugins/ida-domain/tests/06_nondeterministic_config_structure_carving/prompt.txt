# Exercise 06: Configuration Structure Carving
Category: B. Strings, Dataflow-ish Heuristics, and Configuration Recovery

## Binary
input.i64

## Binary Requirements
- Binary with embedded configuration blob:
  - High-entropy region (possibly encrypted outer layer)
  - Unusual alignment or padding
  - Referenced from initialization code
- Config should contain mixed field types:
  - C strings (URLs, paths, keys)
  - Integers (ports, flags, timeouts)
  - Pointers or offsets to other data
  - Fixed-size arrays (IP lists, key material)
  - Nested structures
- Config size: 256-2048 bytes

## Task
Find the likely config blob and script a "carver" that:
1. Identifies base address(es) of config data
2. Parses fields by type inference:
   - String detection (null-terminated, length-prefixed)
   - Integer fields (ports, sizes, flags)
   - Pointer/offset fields
   - Array boundaries
3. Creates an IDA struct type matching the layout
4. Applies the struct to the blob in IDA
5. Annotates each field with decoded meaning

## Expected Output
- Identified config blob location(s)
- Generated IDA struct definition
- Applied struct type in IDA
- Field annotations with semantic meaning
- Decoded config values report

## Expected Class of Solution
- Entropy analysis for blob location
- Heuristic field boundary detection
- Type inference from:
  - Value ranges (port numbers, sizes)
  - Pointer-like values
  - String patterns
- IDA struct creation via idc/idaapi
- Comment/name application for fields

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correct blob identification
- Reasonable field boundary detection
- Struct definition quality
- Semantic annotation usefulness
