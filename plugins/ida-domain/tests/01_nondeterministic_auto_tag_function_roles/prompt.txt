# Exercise 01: Auto-tag Function Roles (Bulk Classification)
Category: A. Triage & Global Mapping

## Binary
input.i64

## Binary Requirements
- Stripped x64 binary (no symbols)
- Should contain ~50+ functions with diverse roles:
  - Crypto functions (AES/RC4/XOR loops, S-box references)
  - Compression (zlib-like patterns, sliding window)
  - Parsing functions (format string refs, field extraction)
  - Memory allocators (malloc/free wrappers, pool management)
  - Logging functions (format strings, timestamp refs)
- Mix of library code and custom implementations

## Task
Write an IDAPython script that classifies functions into buckets (crypto, compression, parsing, allocator, logging) using heuristics:
- Imported APIs and their semantics
- String references and their content
- Basic-block structure (loop density, branch patterns)
- Constant patterns (magic numbers, S-boxes, format strings)
- Callgraph position (leaf vs dispatcher vs wrapper)

## Expected Output
JSON report with:
- Function EA
- Score breakdown per category
- Predicted label with confidence

## Expected Class of Solution
- Heuristic-based classifier using multiple signal sources
- Weighted scoring system combining API usage, string patterns, CFG metrics
- Should handle stripped binaries without relying on symbol names
- Extensible design allowing new categories to be added

## Evaluation Criteria
- Coverage: Does it classify most functions?
- Accuracy: Are the classifications reasonable?
- Robustness: Does it handle edge cases gracefully?
- Code quality: Is the scoring system transparent and tunable?
