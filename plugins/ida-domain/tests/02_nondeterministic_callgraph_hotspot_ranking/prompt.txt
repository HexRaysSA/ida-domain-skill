# Exercise 02: Callgraph Hotspot Ranking
Category: A. Triage & Global Mapping

## Binary
input.i64

## Binary Requirements
- Medium-sized binary (~200-500 functions)
- Clear entrypoint(s) (main, DllMain, or exported init)
- Should contain:
  - Central dispatcher functions (protocol handlers, command processors)
  - Multiple call layers (shallow utils, deep business logic)
  - Some mutual recursion / callback patterns
  - A few isolated utility clusters

## Task
Build a callgraph from the entrypoint(s), compute graph metrics, and rank the top N "central" functions most likely to be dispatchers or protocol handlers.

Metrics to compute:
- Fan-in (number of callers)
- Fan-out (number of callees)
- Betweenness-ish approximations (how often a function lies on paths)
- Depth from entrypoint

Bonus: Detect strongly connected components (mutual recursion / dispatch loops)

## Expected Output
- Ranked list of hotspot functions with metric breakdown
- Optionally: Graphviz export of the callgraph with hotspots highlighted
- SCC report if bonus implemented

## Expected Class of Solution
- Graph construction via IDA's xref APIs
- Custom metric computation (not just fan-in/fan-out)
- Efficient traversal for large graphs
- Clear ranking criteria that can be tuned

## Evaluation Criteria
- Does it identify actual dispatch/handler functions?
- Are the metrics meaningful and well-computed?
- Performance on larger binaries
- Bonus: SCC detection quality
